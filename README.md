# Programming-Assignment--3

Module 1:
Laboratory mice are susceptible to one viral infection in an isolated environment during the experimental study of the animal trial. We have a total of three laboratory mice in the isolated environment. Getting the viral infection is either positive or negative for an individual equally likely. 

1) Find the probability of at least two 2 mice getting an infection given only one infected mouse

2) Find the probability of at least two 2 mice getting an infection given exactly two infected mice 

3) Find the probability of completely no mice getting an infection

4) Find the probability of completely all mice getting an infection

5) Find the probability of exactly two infected mice given at least two 2 mice got an infection
